This course combines engineering design with service learning to provide students hands-on engineering experience while working on a project that addresses a real-world problem in the community. Engineering student teams work directly with customers from the community partner organization. Project work will cover all phases of the engineering design process, with some projects lasting multiple quarters or years. Teams are meant to be vertically integrated, with team members at various levels, and past course knowledge allows students to assume leadership responsibilities.

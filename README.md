This course combines engineering design with service learning to provide students hands-on engineering experience while working on a project that addresses a real-world problem in the community. Engineering student teams work directly with customers from the community partner organization. Project work will cover all phases of the engineering design process, with some projects lasting multiple quarters or years. Teams are meant to be vertically integrated, with team members at various levels, and past course knowledge allows students to assume leadership responsibilities.

## The Stakeholder's Mission

The mission of Hillsdale High School is to enable all students to reach their academic and personal potential. As an educational community of students, parents, and staff, we are committed to sharing the responsibility for the mission.

## Problem Statement

Hillsdale High School needs a rain collection system to become more self-sustainable and to expand and irrigate their community garden in order to better serve their local community by providing food through their Peace Pantry program.

## Identifying Customers
```
- Really depends on the type of information needed
	- “on the job” observations
	- interviews
	- surveys
	- focus groups
```
```
Interviews:

- Example Questions:
	- How: Do you plan to install the < > 
	- How expendable do you want the product to be?
- How will you get more students involved in the project?
- How do you plan on funding the project?
- Realistically, how long do you expect the project to be in place given the current circumstances?
- How much water will be needed for the current garden and future garden if it’s 10 by 30 yards (eyeballing - not exact at all)? How much do they want to expand it?
	- What:
	- What is the overall outcome you hope to achieve
		...are the functions for the product ?
		...environmental stresses does the product have to withstand?
What is the timeframe/ expected lifespan of the product
What kind of skills do you expect people to have in order to maintain the project? Would it be the students , volunteers, and/or faculty/staff?
- Where:
	...have you seen a similar product?
	…will this be located?
- Who:
	...will be using this product?
	...will this product be most beneficial to you?
Who will be the people performing maintenance on this product?
- When
	...is the product needed by <> ?
	...will the product most likely be used?
```
```
Interview Tips:
Go to an interview with at least one other person.
One can focus on asking questions and the other on listening and taking notes
Take notes of everything, not just what you want to hear. Record direct quotes!
Listen carefully  
Have the customer demonstrate
Watch body language; yours and theirs
Do not give your opinion
Be mindful of people’s time!
```
```
Design Canvas:
Gains:
Renewable resources 
Less money spent on water and electricity
Giving back to the community with produce
Pains:
Costs money to water their gardens
California is in a drought
Food insecurity is rising
Schools have a limited budget
```
```
Job-to-be-done: 
Design a system that is sustainable and manageable by anyone in their community
Find a cost effective way to engineer the system as the school has a limited budget
```

```
Customer Need Statements:
Store water
Generate and store electricity via solar panels
Irrigate garden
Collect water
Save money
```

```
Metric
- Single rain barrel - see what average capacity for irrigation system threshold is (in gallons or can also be in barrels depending on how you define that)- min 50 gallons
- Distribution of water is on gallon rate (factor in what plants they’re planting, and what benchmarks and frequencies for maintaining of said plants and harvesting); Distribution in gallons per minute (GPM)
```

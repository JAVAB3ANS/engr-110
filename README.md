This course combines engineering design with service learning to provide students hands-on engineering experience while working on a project that addresses a real-world problem in the community. Engineering student teams work directly with customers from the community partner organization. Project work will cover all phases of the engineering design process, with some projects lasting multiple quarters or years. Teams are meant to be vertically integrated, with team members at various levels, and past course knowledge allows students to assume leadership responsibilities.

## The Stakeholder's Mission

The mission of Hillsdale High School is to enable all students to reach their academic and personal potential. As an educational community of students, parents, and staff, we are committed to sharing the responsibility for the mission.

## Project Brief

Hillsdale High School is extending their community garden and implementing a rainwater collection system to strengthen their sustainability efforts. The community garden provides vegetables to Hillsdale High School activities such as the Peace Pantry. The rainwater collecting system is an environmentally beneficial method of watering the landscape. Our objective at Hillsdale High School is to maximize all resources, resulting in a cleaner environment that is also financially effective. By recycling resources, we will also be able to give back to the community by growing vegetables using an irrigation system that uses recovered rain water.

## Meeting Minute 1 - 09/28th

We went through early team logistics in class, both within our own teams and with co-teams. We then practiced interview questions in preparation for our forthcoming Zoom appointment with Hillsdale High School instructors.

## Meeting Minute 2 - 10/5th

Each team's representatives held a Zoom conference with Dave and JB from Hillsdale High School. In preparation for the site visit, some questions were addressed and a couple more were devised. Because the plant manager was unable to attend the meeting, we began drafting questions for him particularly. The site visit was scheduled on October 12 from 3 to 4:30 p.m.

## Meeting Minute 3 - 10/7th

We had a huge team meeting to plan the next site visit, and I contributed to the list of questions to ask on the site visit.

## Meeting Minute 4 - 10/12th (Site Visit)

The site tour was quite beneficial as we surveyed the present garden location and prospective future gardens. Water collecting sites have been identified in a number of areas. The current gutter systems are unique to each area of campus. We had a fantastic tour of the school as we were given insight into how we might better serve Hillsdale High School.

By keeping the top pathways dry during wet weather, modifying the gutter system in the STEM building would improve the quality of life for students and staff. Instead of a gutter system for the main campus's roofs, drains in various spots drained water through an unknown mechanism buried under the buildings' walls.

## Meeting Minute 5 - 10/14th

The three teams got together to talk about the site visit and the extended variety of collecting sites. We divided the job among three groups. Our team was tasked with assessing areas for the central rainwater collection tank, collecting local rainwater for the existing garden at the special built patio, and gathering data on rainfall and garden watering requirements.

## Meeting Minute 6 - 10/19th

We had a quick team meeting before our check in with Dr. Jak. We discussed which task each team member is responsible for:

- Jason: Surveying sites for central water collection
- Eric: Designing a rainwater collection system for the special ed patio
- Sunny: Researching data collection tools (Weather Station, water meter) and collecting historical weather data.

## Meeting Minute 7 - 10/23th

Researching options for data collection:

- As my goal is to survey and identify potential places to store water and infrastructure behind it, I will need to research what we need for filtration and pumping, while adding to the list of places for potential water storage.
 
- If we implement on the red roof, which has already been measured, we will have the option to directly pipe water from that location to the tanks ala physically move water from one place to another.

- We don't know the campus infrastructure well enough so have to we ask questions to support our system and garner good outcomes.

- In terms of collecting and filtering water, there will be a a physical filter that will drain water for the plants and not for drinking so don't need to worry about UV too much to kill pathogens. We need a metal mesh to put on top of the container (preferably from Home Depot) then pour water into the plants along with their leaves. In our case, quantum disinfection is key as it is suitable and convenient for the average-joe homesteader to carry out on a weekly basis. This system employs cutting-edge technology that employs a positively charged surface on the filter medium that draws electrons in pathogens, which are killed when they come into touch with the dynamic Activated Silica ceramic surface.
